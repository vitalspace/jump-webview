# Jump Odyssey

## Inspiration
We were inspired to create a dynamic and engaging puzzle game that combines physics-based mechanics with simple yet addictive gameplay. We wanted a game that rewards precision, timing, and quick reflexes while providing players a way to compete globally.

## What it does
Jump Odyssey is a puzzle game where players rotate platforms and baskets using mouse movements to guide a rising ball. The ball ascends upon colliding with baskets, increasing the score as the player progresses. The challenge lies in aligning the ball perfectly with the rotating baskets to keep it from falling. The game features two difficulty modes: Easy and Medium. Players can compete for high scores and claim a spot on the global leaderboard.

## How we built it
We used modern web technologies to deliver smooth and interactive gameplay:
- **Svelte**: For building the UI and game structure efficiently.
- **enable3d.js**: To incorporate 3D graphics and interactions.
- **ammo.js**: For realistic physics and collisions.
- **Tailwind CSS**: To style and enhance the game's appearance.

By integrating these tools, we created a seamless experience with responsive gameplay and polished visuals.

## Challenges we ran into
- **Physics Integration**: Getting the ball's movement and collision detection to work smoothly with ammo.js required fine-tuning to ensure realistic behavior.
- **Mouse-based Rotation**: Ensuring the mouse movement accurately rotated the platforms and baskets without lag was a challenge.
- **Difficulty Balancing**: Tuning the two modes (Easy and Medium) to provide a challenging but fun experience took multiple iterations.
- **Global Leaderboard**: Implementing the leaderboard system to save and display global scores reliably was a critical part of the project.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Successfully creating a fun, engaging, and challenging gameplay experience.  
- Implementing realistic physics and smooth 3D rotations.  
- Building a global leaderboard that encourages competition.  
- Polishing the UI to make the game visually appealing and user-friendly.  

## What we learned
Throughout the development of Jump Odyssey, we learned:
- How to integrate physics engines like ammo.js with enable3d.js.  
- Optimizing mouse-based controls for better user experience.  
- Fine-tuning gameplay difficulty to cater to both casual and competitive players.  
- Combining Svelte with modern tools to create interactive 3D games efficiently.

## What's next for Jump Odyssey
We plan to expand and improve Jump Odyssey with the following features:  
- **New Game Modes**: Introduce harder difficulties and special challenges.  
- **Power-ups**: Add items that enhance gameplay, such as slow motion or score multipliers.  
- **Customization**: Allow players to customize ball skins and platform themes.  
- **Multiplayer Mode**: Compete in real-time with friends or other players online.  
- **Mobile Support**: Optimize the game for mobile devices to reach a wider audience.

Jump Odyssey is just the beginning, and we're excited to see how far it can go!
